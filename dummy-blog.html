        My First Blog Ever !! Blogs became very interesting to write after tanay sir made it compulsory to do 
        blogs in Neog camp !! Well I dont know how to write blogs properly, </p>
      <p>I Would like to write about my Journey with neog camp over here. </p>
        I was in my second year and was in a dilemma about what to choose as my path in my career, then I had
        chosen AI as my path , I thought AI would work out for me and was continuing my path in AI, I have done some
        projects on AI. But it wasnt quite worthy. <p>I kinda have a obsession for Neat & Clean UI's, I Follow many
        people for my Inspiration and I was searching for more people and that's how I met Tanay Pratap, I Went through
        his posts listened to his Podcasts and everything, then I listened to tanay sir's advice and changed my path 
        to web development, and later I got Interested in his neog.camp , without hesitation I wanted to join desparately
        at that time neog's first set of batch was already done. </p> <p>I thought I was late and later I slowly saw his videos
        on my own pace. Some of them were very interesting, at some cases I had myself lost again would see the whole 
        video again and do it again rectify my mistakes. His Teaching Method was very new to me but I gradually got toouch of
        it, then later while I was slowly doing projects at my own pace , Pair Programming videos came up with new topics
        until mark 15 , I had a hope that Neog would again start and take students for their second batch and later it
        was confirmed.</p> <p>Later I learnt all what sir taught and my portfolio is far better than before, I had this 
        Imposter Syndrome that I wasnt meant for coding and stuff. Later after learning with Tanay my confidence 
        level boosted up at rocket speed and my Imposter Syndrome was gone for good. <br></p><p>Thanks to tanay sir for coming Into 
        our lives !!.</p><br> <p>Ps: I Know my Formatting is very bad , gonna update it soon.</p>
