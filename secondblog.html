      <p>
        Kodachadri is a hilly region famous for its weather and trek situated in Shimoga district nearby to Kollur Mookambika temple.</p>
        <p>I had visited Kodachadri in October month which is the best month to witness soul-satisfying trek experience and flora and fauna at its best. Kodachadri is ~400 kms from Bangalore and takes around 7-8 hrs to reach. We took the Bhadra wildlife sanctuary route to travel across the greener side. I had made this trip along my colleagues. We stayed at Malnad Homestay hosted by Jayalakshmi (famously known by Bigg Boss Nurse Jayakka) & Vishruth. The hospitality served by this homestay won our hearts.</p>
        <p>We started off the trek around 8 am directly from our homestay , few start from the checkpost as well. It is a 12km trek one way hence need to start early so that you can be saved from scorching heat. It was around 2 km walk till checkpost from homestay where we deposit a fee for plastic items and then we started off our trek.</p>
        <p>The trek was through a dense forest in the beginning, small pathways , greenery both sides, since we visited in monsoon the lands were wets and slippery at certains areas (ensure good trekking shoes are put on). We could smell the fresh mud while trekking, birds chirping, cool breeze, dense forest greenery , it just makes your heart fill with contentment.</p>
        <p>Be aware of the electrical lines across certains lands put by land owners in order to avoid trespassing.</p>
        <p>We were attacked by many and many leeches all through the way until the first shop stop for rest. Please have a watch on the leeches, these are tiny little creatures you cannot make out via own eyes until they stretch across (carry salt and apply amrutanjan on legs beforehand).</p>
        <p>Hidlumane falls is the first stop which embarks half of the trek. Chill and enjoy the falls , don’t forget to sit under the waterfall and enjoy the heavy stream of water falling on your body, it’s a kind of massage to strained body.</p>
        <p>Once enjoyed hear get started for the next difficult part of the trek.Next part of the trek was valley to valley crossing, which was most tiresome as a lot of steep mountains needs to be trekked at a strected , very minimal flat land is seen here. It seemed like a never ending valley to valley trek for me , almost 4-5 valleys we trekked (up-down, up-down). But once at the highest valley peak the view from top just makes all worth it. Passing clouds, chill and fresh air, perfect view of kodachadri and its hills, lush greenery just fills such happiness to heart and soul. After enjoying at the peak we trekked down to the lunch spot where all trekkers sitby , relax, enjoy a good meal. We had our packed lunch and enjoy fresh water running through small streams .</p>
        <p>After a good meal, we started to trek up to the jeep point , again it was a steep trek but it started drizzling and it just added to the trek. We reached the jeep point at 4pm, nothing could be viewed from that point as due to rain all valleys were covered with fog. From jeep point, one need to take the Jeep to reach back to the checkpost point. I would suggest everyone to take this jeep ride as it is one hell of a ride once cannot miss. The journey was so adventurous, scary, almost to death at certain crossing that one cannot forget. 45 mins of life experience jeep ride it was. We reached back the stay at 5pm with loads of memories, contentment, stories to share, amazing heritage.</p>
